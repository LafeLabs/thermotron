# Brand

What is the thermotron brand? It is the thermotron word mark, the thermotron logo, and the idea of thermometry for the masses! It is the semiotics of thermodynamics: the Plank blackbody curve, a noise signal in either time or frequency domain, a red liquid thermometer, the sun, the Earth, flame, ice cubes, flowing fluids, flowing gasses, heat engines, radiation, conduction, convection. All of these are part of the "THERMOTRON BRAND".  And we note that these are not owned. They are out there!  Lord Kelvin!  Max Planck!  James Watt!  For better or worse, these are the influencers of our history, where we come from as the THERMOTRON NETWORK!
