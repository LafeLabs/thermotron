Buy it from Adafruit! It's about 25 dollars.  It's a great product, and it is what powers everything here. There are other cheaper boards in the Feather line, but this one has a screen which lets you read out the temperature directly even if the device is just running on a battery or solar panel.  It behaves like a keyboard.  You push the button to start and push the button to stop.  Be careful not to plug it in and turn it on with the cursor in someplace where it will make a mess if text gets typed!  Always go to a THERMOTRON LIVE PLOT page when you plug in the physical THERMOTRON.

This runs [CircuitPython](../circuitpython).
