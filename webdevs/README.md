# Web Devs

Web devs maintain web pages live, by checking in periodically on a page and updating it.  If a page is attacked by trolls, devs will nuke them from orbit as needed and make new pages.  A webdev can use pages hosted by a [webhost](../webhost), who doesn't have to be a webdev.  Webdevs make sure there are live instance of THERMOTRON for use by [scientists](../scientists), [gardeners](../gardeners/), [magicians](../magicians/), [sponsors](../sponsors), and other people in the [network](../network/).
