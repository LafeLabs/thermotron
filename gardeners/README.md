Gardeners study how energy flows through the living Earth, from compost to soil to rock to tree to bush to insect to fungi.  Gardeners connect the rest of the [network](../network/) to the living Earth.  They can get thermometers made by [makers](../makers), and paid for by [sponsors](../sponsors), and then record data on web servers hosted by [web hosts](../webhosts/) and maintained by [web developers](../webdevs/), which is then analyzed by [scientists](../scientists). 

Become one with the living soil, learn to feel how energy flows through the system!
