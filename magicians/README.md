# The Magicians

The magicians replicate the set. We replicate ourselves by finding new people to become magicians who also replicate the set. And we find the replicators of each element of the set, building [network](../network/) after [network](../network/) of self-replicating [network](../network/)s of people and objects and places.  We channel energy, information, and materials through the physical world by building information structures of people and technology to ease this process.

We imagine this self-replicating set and it becomes real.

We call on all the other folk of the [network](../network/)! the gardeners, the scientists, the sponsors, the web devs and web hosts, and anyone else who supports [THERMOTRON](../)!

We call the THERMOCORPS!  It is time! 

Time to build an infinite [network](../network/) of self-replicating sets of things which can consume the old consumer system as fungus consumes a log!

We start with the humble thermometer and measure the flow of heat through our world!

We share these data as we share the instruments which take them!

We pass the instrument along to the next person and tell them to pass it along to still another person after that!

We share our memes on the trash magic [network](../network/)!

The [network](../network/) is itself a meme!

This is a [network](../network/) of memes!

The network of free thermometer measurements!
