The README files are files written in the [Markdown language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).  This is a language which is very widely used in the documentation of open source software and hardware both. It is the default language of [Github](https://github.com) repositories, and renders in a web browser when you point them to a repository.

These exist to replicate all the elements of a set in order to replicate that set.  Each README should have a link back to itself in the title, and a QR code which links to it.

Local web servers may also render these files using the [showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) [JavaScript](../javascript) library.

Markdown syntax all creators of README's should learn include:

 - headings are made with the "#" character, sub-headings are made by stacking them, for example "##" and "###" and so on
 - lists of elements without numbers are created using space, dash, space and then text
 - lists with numbers are created using space, then a number followed by a period, and then text
 - hyperlinks are created by means of square brackets with text, followed directly(without spaces) by parenthesis with the url the link should point to
 - images are created with "!\[alt text\]\(image url\)" 
 - *Italic* is created by placing one asterisk on both sides of whatever text is to be made italic
 - **Bold** is created by placing a pair of adjacent asterisks around the text to be made bold
 - code snippets are between a set of three backticks,  \`\`\`, both to open and to close
 - use single dollars signs for equations inline($E = mc^2$) and double dollars signs for standalone equations, assuming that [MathJax](../mathjax/) is turned on.
