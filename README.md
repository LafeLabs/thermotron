## TALE

I am an applied physicists by trade and by training, and I go by Trash Robot on the Internet. The THERMOTRON is a free hardware implementation of a project I was paid to work on while working at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in suburban Maryland, half way between DC and Baltimore.  We had a complex system of pipes and tubes and needed to log temperatures at various points around the system.  This is the sort of task that is supposed to be "easy".  All you have to do is buy stuff and it "just works".  But what system? And how will it log?  How will it talk to your existing systems? How do you make the trade offs between cost and accuracy?

What I concluded was that I2C sensors from [Adafruit](https://adafrut.com) would be the easiest way to do this, with the best trade off of accuracy vs. cost, as well as removing a bunch of the cost associated with engineering that the user has to do to make a real system.
